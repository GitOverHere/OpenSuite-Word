<h1>About</h1>
<div class="description">
<p> Supportlabs is an alternative revenue system designed to generate extra revenue for content creators.
Patrons can donate to content creators not only with money, but also by completing surveys and
watching ads.</p>
<p> With the youtube ad crisis in full swing. People are scrambling to find ways to support themselves.
. Some of them are forced to quit making content. I was extremly worried,
so i created this website that wouldd allow people to make a link by which people that click on the link
can be supported. Some say this is reveutionary, others say to go back to the drawing board. There is only
one way to find out if this works.With the youtube ad crisis in full swing. </p>
<p>

Supportlabs started in 2017 as a project to test building webpages. It is now grown into a full website with several features and incredible community.
